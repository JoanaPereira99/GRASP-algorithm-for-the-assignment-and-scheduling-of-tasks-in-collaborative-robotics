The program was coded in java in IntellJ IDEA

The files Entity, MenuType, Option and ParseOption must be inside a file called Enumerators.
File GRASP must be inside a file called Functions
The files Group, GroupThread, Job, SuperGroup, Task and Timelapse must be inside a file called Objects
Then, files Enumerators, Funcrions, Objects, Data, Main and Menu must be inside file called com.
