# An algorithm inspired in GRASP for the assignment and scheduling of tasks in collaborative robotics
A algorithm inspired in the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure is presented for the assignment asn scheduling of tasks between a human worker and a collaborative robot

The program was coded in java in IntellJ IDEA

The files Entity, MenuType, Option and ParseOption must be inside a file called Enumerators.
File GRASP must be inside a file called Functions
The files Group, GroupThread, Job, SuperGroup, Task and Timelapse must be inside a file called Objects
Then, files Enumerators, Funcrions, Objects, Data, Main and Menu must be inside file called com.

For testing the program it is recommended to use the original zipped file. Therefore, if you are interested in testing the program, please contact me through the following email: joanapereira99@ua.pt
